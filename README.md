Headline:Hi my name is Vincent Chen I am a software developer currently studying at Thinkful with four years experience in hospitality. 

Bio:
I have always been fascinating with programing because i loved solving and figuring how to do things. Working in hospitality I would always have to think of ways to exceed guest expectations and put out any fires that may arise. Just like in coding, when you are given a task, you need to figure out how to go about solving it. This made me realize that becoming a developer was the perfect fit for me.

Project title: Countries Quiz App

Project Description (1 paragraph): For our first project we were tasked to create a quizz app using what we learned in the first couple of weeks. I made a very simple and clean looking app that tests your knowledge on countries. You can keep track of your score on top and at the end it will tell you how you did. 

List of technologies used: HTML, CSS, and JS
